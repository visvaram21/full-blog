Progress of the Gun Blog website

1. First I build a basic website with html and css with some colours and without any database.
2. Then upgrade it to use php and also laravel framework in it.
3. I use some css files and themes from bootstrap to the website looks attractive.
4. Then I set up database using xampp and connect it with with the laravel migration.
5. I also add some functionalties such as deleting the post, editting the post, navigate back to blogs page, and also creating new blog post.
6. Once that part was done, then I and my partner joined together to integrate the authentication in it to make my Gun Blog more secure.
7. We use the laravel make auth function to have the security protocols such as register, login, forgot password adn reset password.
8. This function was also integrated as well with the database for the records.
